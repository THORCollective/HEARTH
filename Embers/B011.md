|      B011        | Establish a normal utilization of Xcode and Xcode projects across workstations/servers. Xcode projects are commonly used by software developers and can be targeted by MacOS malware. | Initial Access  | Indicators of Xcode usage can be found in EDR telemetry and potential for detection if Xcode is not utilized/approved in the environment. | #InitialAccess #Baseline    | Collin McClaine |

## Why
- Xcode projects can be infected and the malware can propagate when Xcode projects are shared by developers. 

- Potential to uncover shadow IT use of Xcode in an environment to develop unapproved applications. This Also leaves developers at risk to interacting with infected Xcode projects. 

- Understand exposure to potential infected Xcode project by knowing where Xcode is utilized in the environment.

## Implementation Notes
- Indicators of Xcode usage can easily be found in EDR telemetry. 

- Xcode usage may go unnoticed for the most part if you are in a windows heavy environment. 

- Potential for detection if Xcode is not utilized/approved in the environment.
