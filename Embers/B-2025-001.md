# B-2025-001

Establish a normal behavior baseline for VPC peering across your AWS environment, so that future deviations (e.g., unauthorized peering, unusual traffic patterns) can be more easily hunted/detected. Peering may be normal in your environment, but this is an opportunity to not only understand your cloud environment on a deeper level, but to collaborate with other teams to ensure the proper controls are in place.

## Why
The hunt helps establish a baseline for VPC peering activity, enabling detection of lateral movement in the cloud. It also supports risk reduction through targeted arcitecture review and enhances overall visibility into cloud network operations.

## Implementation Notes
**Things to Explore**
- When do peering requests typically occur?
- Who initiated the peering? What is their role?
- Unusual/anonymous source IP initiating VPC peering
- Repeated _RejectVpcPerringConnection_ events followed by an _AcceptVpcPeeringConnection_ event
- Peering connections between non-production and production environments
- NACLs and associated security groups

This list is a foundation, it's not exhaustive.
