| B012 | Baseline all non-human identities associated with AI agents, automation frameworks, and agentic tools across the environment to identify orphaned service accounts from decommissioned agents that retain active permissions. | Persistence | AI agent deployments are accelerating but no lifecycle management standard exists for their identities. Orphaned agent accounts with API keys, OAuth tokens, and service principals persist long after the agent is decommissioned — retaining permissions with no owner and no monitoring. | #persistence #T1078_004 #non_human_identity #service_account #ai_agent #orphan_account #lifecycle | Jinx (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- AI agents are provisioned with service accounts, API keys, and OAuth tokens that often carry broad permissions — but unlike human accounts, they are rarely included in offboarding or access review processes when the agent is retired
- Orphaned agent identities are attractive targets for adversaries because they have established permissions, generate no regular user activity to compare against, and are unlikely to trigger password rotation or MFA challenges
- Baselining agent identities requires correlating across identity providers, cloud IAM, SaaS platforms, and CI/CD systems to build a complete inventory — most organizations have no single view of how many agent identities exist or who owns them
- Establishing this baseline enables detection of dormant account reactivation, permission escalation on unowned accounts, and identifies accounts that should be decommissioned to reduce the organization's attack surface
