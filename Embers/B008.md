| B008         | Threat actors added an existing or newly created (B004) user to a privileged Active Directory (AD) security group to maintain persistence or achieve other objectives in an elevated context. | Privilege Escalation      | Establish a baseline for additions to privileged AD security groups using Windows event logs (e.g., 4732, 4728, 4756). Suggested target security groups include (built-in) Administrators, Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, and Schema Admins. See reference 1 (R1) for a suggested list of security groups, the prioritization of specific groups is likely to depend on the defender's environment.  | #baseline #privilege_escalation #anomalydetection |[Jon Perez](https://bsky.app/profile/j-nohandle.bsky.social)

## Why

- Threat actors abuse privileged AD security groups to provide an account they control with an elevated context to achieve additional objectives/tactics.
- Performing this baseline enables defenders quickly identify and investigate additions to privileged AD groups.
- Defenders will learn more about their environment and are likely to find internal data sources that will help determine the disposition of the addition to the security group.
