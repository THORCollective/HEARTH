## Why
- The use of Cobalt Strike's psexec_psh for executing a PowerShell beacon on the domain controller is a critical behavior to detect as it allows adversaries to maintain persistence and control over the network.
- If this specific technique succeeds, adversaries can execute commands, deploy additional tools, and move laterally across the network, potentially leading to significant data breaches or system damage.
- This specific implementation ties to larger campaigns as Cobalt Strike is a widely used threat emulation tool, often repurposed by adversaries for malicious activities.
- The technique was chosen over others mentioned in the CTI due to its high actionability (observable in logs/telemetry), direct impact on adversary objectives, uniqueness to this specific threat, and common detection gaps in security tools.
