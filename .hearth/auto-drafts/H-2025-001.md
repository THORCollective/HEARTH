## Why
- Detecting the misuse of compromised credentials is crucial as it often serves as the initial entry point for threat actors into a network.
- If this specific technique succeeds, it allows threat actors to gain a foothold in the network, potentially leading to further exploitation, lateral movement, and persistence.
- This specific implementation ties to larger campaigns as it has been observed being used by the Fog ransomware group, indicating a potential link to this threat actor.
- The SonicWall VPN was chosen for this technique due to its widespread use in corporate environments, making it a lucrative target for threat actors seeking to gain initial access to a network.
