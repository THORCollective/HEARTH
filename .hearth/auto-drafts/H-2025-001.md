## Why
- Sliver C2 executables are a distinctive tool used by the Fog ransomware group for command-and-control operations. Detecting their use can provide a strong indicator of this specific threat group's activity.
- The immediate tactical impact of this technique is the maintenance of remote access and control over compromised systems. This enables the adversary to execute further malicious activities, including data exfiltration and ransomware deployment.
- This specific implementation ties to larger campaigns as it is a common technique used by the Fog ransomware group, indicating a potential widespread attack against industries across multiple continents.
- The use of Sliver C2 executables was chosen over other techniques mentioned in the CTI due to its actionability (evident in logs/telemetry), direct impact on adversary objectives, uniqueness to the specific threat, and common detection gap in security tools.
