## Why
- The use of PowerShell scripts to install AnyDesk is a clear indicator of malicious activity, as legitimate administrators would typically use the GUI or official installers for such tasks.
- If this technique succeeds, adversaries can maintain persistence on the compromised VPN servers, allowing them to continuously access the network and potentially move laterally or escalate privileges.
- This specific implementation ties to larger campaigns by the Fog ransomware group, which is known to use similar techniques for maintaining persistence.
- The use of PowerShell scripts provides the adversaries with a high degree of flexibility and stealth, as these scripts can be easily modified and are often overlooked by security tools.
