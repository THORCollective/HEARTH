## Why
- Detecting the use of compromised credentials is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to the network. This behavior is significant because it is the first step in the attack lifecycle, allowing the threat actor to establish a foothold in the network.
- If this technique succeeds, the threat actor gains access to the network, which can lead to further exploitation, lateral movement, and persistence.
- This specific implementation is tied to larger campaigns by the Fog ransomware group, which has been known to use compromised VPN credentials for initial access.
- This technique was chosen over others mentioned in the CTI because it is the most actionable. VPN logs can be analyzed to detect unusual login patterns or access from suspicious IP addresses.
