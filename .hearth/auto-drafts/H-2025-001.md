## Why
- Detecting the use of Impacket Secretsdump tool is critical as it is a known tool for dumping credentials from Windows systems, especially domain controllers. 
- If successful, this technique allows the threat actor to gain access to a large number of user credentials, which can be used for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and further attacks within the network.
- This specific implementation is often used in larger campaigns that aim to gain control over an entire network, often as a precursor to deploying ransomware or other destructive payloads.
- The use of Impacket Secretsdump tool was chosen over other techniques mentioned in the CTI due to its high impact, clear evidence in logs, and the fact that it is often missed by security tools due to its legitimate use in network administration.
