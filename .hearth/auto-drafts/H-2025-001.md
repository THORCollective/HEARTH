## Why
- Detecting this behavior is critical as it allows adversaries to gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources within the network, potentially leading to further compromise.
- If this technique succeeds, adversaries can escalate their privileges, move laterally across the network, and potentially gain full control over the domain.
- This specific implementation is indicative of the Fog ransomware group's modus operandi, as they have been known to exploit Active Directory vulnerabilities using credential theft tools.
- This technique was chosen over others mentioned in the CTI due to its high impact and actionability. Exploitation of Active Directory vulnerabilities leaves clear evidence in logs and telemetry, making it easier to detect and respond to.
