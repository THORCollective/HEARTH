## Why
- Detecting the use of compromised credentials is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to the network. 
- If this technique succeeds, adversaries gain a foothold in the network, which can lead to further exploitation and potential data loss.
- This specific implementation ties to larger campaigns as it is a common initial access technique used by various threat actors.
- The use of compromised VPN credentials was chosen over other techniques mentioned in the CTI due to its high actionability and direct impact on the adversary's objectives.
