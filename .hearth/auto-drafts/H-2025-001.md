## Why
- Detecting the use of compromised VPN credentials is critical as it is often the first step in an attack chain. Identifying this behavior can help prevent further exploitation of the network.
- If this technique succeeds, adversaries gain a foothold in the network, which can lead to further exploitation, lateral movement, and eventual data exfiltration or ransomware deployment.
- This specific implementation is indicative of the Fog ransomware group's modus operandi, as they are known to use compromised VPN credentials for initial access.
- The use of compromised SonicWall VPN credentials was chosen over other techniques mentioned in the CTI due to its high actionability and direct impact on the adversary's objectives. VPN logs can provide clear evidence of this behavior, and detecting it can directly prevent further stages of the attack.
