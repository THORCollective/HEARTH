## Why
- Detecting the use of PowerShell scripts to install AnyDesk is critical as it indicates that the threat actors are attempting to maintain persistence on the compromised systems. This behavior is a clear sign of a breach and requires immediate attention.
- If this technique succeeds, the threat actors will have persistent access to the compromised systems, allowing them to carry out further malicious activities such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or deploying additional payloads.
- The use of AnyDesk for maintaining persistence is a distinctive behavior of the Fog ransomware group, tying this specific implementation to their larger campaigns.
- This technique was chosen over others mentioned in the CTI due to its high actionability and impact. The installation of AnyDesk via PowerShell scripts leaves clear evidence in logs/telemetry, and maintaining persistence is a critical step in achieving the adversary's objectives.
