## Why
- Detecting the use of compromised VPN credentials is crucial as it can prevent unauthorized access to the network, which could lead to further exploitation of the network infrastructure.
- If this technique succeeds, adversaries can gain initial access to the network, which can lead to further exploitation, lateral movement, and persistence within the network.
- This specific implementation ties to larger campaigns as it is a common technique used by the Fog ransomware group, as noted in the CTI report.
- The use of compromised VPN credentials was chosen over other techniques mentioned in the CTI due to its high actionability, as VPN logs can provide clear evidence of unauthorized access attempts.
