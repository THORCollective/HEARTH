## Why
- Detecting the use of compromised VPN credentials is crucial as it represents the first step in the attack chain. Early detection can prevent further exploitation and lateral movement within the network.
- If this technique succeeds, adversaries gain a foothold in the network, which can lead to further exploitation, data exfiltration, or ransomware deployment.
- This specific implementation ties to larger campaigns as the Fog ransomware group is known to use compromised VPN credentials for initial access.
- The use of compromised VPN credentials was chosen over other techniques mentioned in the CTI due to its high actionability, impact, and detection gap. VPN logs can provide clear evidence of this activity, and it directly enables the adversary's objectives. However, it is often overlooked by security tools.
