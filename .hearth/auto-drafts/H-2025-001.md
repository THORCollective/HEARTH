## Why
- PowerShell scripts provide a flexible and powerful means for adversaries to automate tasks such as software installation. In this case, the installation of AnyDesk allows the adversaries to maintain remote access to the compromised systems, even after the initial intrusion vector has been closed.
- If this technique succeeds, the adversaries will have a persistent foothold in the victim's network, allowing them to continue their operations even if other parts of their infrastructure are disrupted. This could potentially lead to further exploitation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
- The use of AnyDesk, a legitimate remote access tool, is a common tactic used by many threat groups. This specific implementation ties into larger campaigns by providing a reliable and stealthy means of maintaining access to compromised systems.
- The choice of this technique over others mentioned in the CTI report may be due to the ease of use and effectiveness of PowerShell scripts, as well as the stealth and persistence provided by AnyDesk.
