## Why
- Detecting the use of breached VPN credentials is critical as it represents the initial foothold an adversary gains in the target network. This initial access is the foundation upon which the rest of the attack chain is built.
- If this specific technique succeeds, adversaries can gain unauthorized access to the target network, potentially leading to further exploitation, lateral movement, and eventual data exfiltration or disruption.
- This specific implementation ties to larger campaigns as the use of valid accounts, especially those associated with VPNs, is a common tactic employed by various threat actors. In this case, it is linked to a ransomware affiliate possibly connected to the Fog ransomware group.
- The technique was chosen over others mentioned in the CTI due to its high actionability (VPN logs can be monitored for suspicious activity), direct impact (enables adversary objectives), and uniqueness (distinctive of this specific threat).
