## Why
- Detecting the use of PowerShell scripts to install AnyDesk is crucial as it indicates that threat actors are attempting to maintain persistence on the compromised systems. This behavior is a clear sign of a successful initial compromise and the beginning of the lateral movement phase.
- If this technique succeeds, threat actors can maintain access to the compromised systems even after initial access vectors have been closed. This allows them to continue their operations, potentially leading to data exfiltration, further system compromise, or deployment of ransomware.
- This specific implementation ties to larger campaigns as it is a common technique used by the Fog ransomware group. By detecting this behavior, we can potentially link the activity to this group and anticipate their next moves based on their known TTPs.
- The use of PowerShell scripts to install AnyDesk was chosen over other techniques mentioned in the CTI due to its high actionability. PowerShell script execution leaves clear evidence in logs, making it easier to detect compared to other techniques such as exploiting Active Directory or using Sliver C2 executables for command-and-control operations.
