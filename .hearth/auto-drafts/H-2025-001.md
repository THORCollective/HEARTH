## Why
- Detecting the use of compromised VPN credentials is critical as it is often the first step in an attack chain, allowing adversaries to gain a foothold in the network.
- If this technique succeeds, adversaries can gain access to the internal network, potentially bypassing perimeter defenses and giving them the ability to move laterally, escalate privileges, or perform other malicious activities.
- This specific implementation is tied to larger campaigns by the Fog ransomware group, which has been observed using compromised VPN credentials for initial access in multiple incidents.
- The use of compromised SonicWall VPN credentials was chosen over other techniques mentioned in the CTI due to its actionability (evident in VPN logs), impact (directly enables adversary objectives), uniqueness (distinctive of this specific threat), and detection gap (commonly missed by security tools).
