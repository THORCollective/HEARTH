## Why

- Detecting this specific behavior matters because it allows adversaries to gain higher-level permissions on the system, which can lead to further compromise of the network.
- If this behavior succeeds, adversaries can gain full control over the system, allowing them to execute commands, install malicious software, and access sensitive data.
- This behavior is connected to known campaigns that target internet-facing servers for initial access and then escalate privileges to gain control over the network.
