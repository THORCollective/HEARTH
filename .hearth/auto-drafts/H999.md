| H001 | Threat actors are exploiting AnyDesk to establish direct command and control connections | TA0011 - Command and Control | Threat actors are exploiting AnyDesk to establish direct, covert command and control connections | #AnyDesk #CommandAndControl | hearth-auto-intel |

## Why
- By exploiting AnyDesk for direct connections, threat actors can bypass network security monitoring tools and maintain covert control over compromised systems.
- If successful, threat actors can maintain persistent access and execute malicious activities undetected.
- This behavior is critical for threat detection and response teams to monitor and detect unauthorized remote access and potential data exfiltration.

## Observable in Logs or Artifacts
- AnyDesk logs can show unauthorized connections and activities.
- Network logs may show unusual traffic patterns associated with AnyDesk connections.
