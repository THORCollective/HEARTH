## Why

- Detecting this specific behavior is crucial as it represents the initial point of entry for the threat actors into the network. By exploiting known vulnerabilities, they are able to gain unauthorized access and execute remote code, setting the stage for further malicious activities.
- If this behavior succeeds, threat actors can establish a foothold in the network, escalate privileges, move laterally, and eventually deploy ransomware or exfiltrate sensitive data.
- This behavior is consistent with known campaigns that target internet-facing servers with known vulnerabilities. It represents a significant risk as many organizations rely on Confluence for project management and collaboration, potentially exposing sensitive information.
