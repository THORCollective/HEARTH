| H017    | Adversaries are exploiting memory safety issues in the Apache mod_lua module to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on Apache web servers. | Privilege Escalation | Based on ATT&CK technique T1068, using CVE-2021-44790 | #privilegeescalation #exploit #apache | [hearth-auto-intel](https://github.com/THORCollective/HEARTH) |

## Why
- Detecting this precise behavior is crucial as it allows adversaries to gain elevated privileges, potentially giving them full control over the compromised Apache web server.
- If this specific technique succeeds, adversaries can execute arbitrary code with high privileges, leading to further system compromise, data theft, or disruption of services.
- This specific implementation ties to larger campaigns as it allows adversaries to compromise web servers, which can be used as a stepping stone to infiltrate the internal network or to host malicious content.
- This technique was chosen over others mentioned in the CTI due to its high impact (arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges) and its actionability, as exploitation attempts can be detected in web server logs.
