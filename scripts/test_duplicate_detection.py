| Hunt # | Idea / Hypothesis | Tactic | Notes | Tags | Submitter |
|--------|-------------------|--------|-------|------|-----------|
| | Threat actors are using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet to download encrypted payloads from Discord CDN to evade network detection. | Defense Evasion | Based on ATT&CK technique T1071.001. | #defense-evasion #execution | test-user |

## Why
- This technique is commonly used by threat actors to evade detection
- Discord CDN is often trusted and may bypass security controls
