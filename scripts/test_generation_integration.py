    Threat Intelligence Report: Advanced Tunneling Campaign
    
    Threat actors are increasingly using Chisel, an open-source tunneling utility,
    to establish covert communication channels. The tool creates SOCKS proxies on
    compromised hosts, allowing adversaries to bypass network security controls
    such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
    
    Technical Details:
    - Tool: Chisel (github.com/jpillora/chisel)
    - Technique: SOCKS proxy creation (MITRE T1090.001)
    - Tactic: Command and Control
    - Purpose: Bypass network controls, conceal C2 traffic
    - Targets: Windows and Linux systems
    
    Attack Flow:
    1. Initial compromise via phishing
    2. Download and install Chisel binary
    3. Establish SOCKS proxy tunnel
    4. Route C2 traffic through tunnel
    5. Maintain persistent access
    
    Indicators:
    - Chisel binary execution
    - Network connections to tunneling infrastructure
    - SOCKS proxy traffic patterns
