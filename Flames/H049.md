## Why
- The hunt for malicious mailbox rules that focus on concealing adversary presence addresses both persistence and the risk of internal spearphishing.

- Potential impacts include, but are not limited to: data loss, adversary dwell time, and lateral movement to other services. This risk is increasingly prevalent in environments where audit visibility is limited or mailbox activity is not closely monitored within SaaS platforms.

- This hunt can be valuable across environments of all sizes, helping uncover nefarious activity ranging from everyday business email compromise to more sophisticated campaigns attributed to eCrime groups.

## Implementation Notes
Apply a multi-faceted approach by looking for:
**Mailbox rule names with minimal or random naming conventions: single characters, repeated letters, or whitespace**
- Examples: "7", "dd", "..." 

**Mailbox rules moving to a variety of folders and marking as read**
- Examples: RSS Feeds, Junk Mail, Conversation History, Deleted Items

**Mailbox rules flagging the subject or body containing specific words**
- Examples: "hack", "wire", "undeliverable" (commonly seen when users are facilitating phishing from the compromised mailbox in bulk)

When tailored to your environment, this hunt can become a nice automated hunt/detection.
