# H019
Threat actors are leveraging Linux Executable and Linkage Format (ELF) files to deploy malware families on cloud infrastructure endpoints running Linux OS, with the immediate tactical goal of gaining unauthorized access and maintaining persistence.

## Why
- Detecting the use of ELF files to deploy malware is critical as it signifies a targeted attack on Linux-based cloud infrastructure, which is widely used in enterprise environments.
- The tactical impact of a successful attack includes unauthorized access to cloud infrastructure, potential data breaches, and the ability for the threat actor to maintain persistence within the compromised system.
- This behavior could be linked to larger campaigns targeting cloud infrastructure, given the increasing trend of threat actors weaponizing ELF files.
