| H074 | An adversary is creating temporary virtual network interfaces on ESXi-hosted virtual machines to pivot into internal networks and SaaS infrastructure targeting organizations with VMware environments to maintain covert lateral movement channels. | Lateral Movement | UNC6201 ghost NIC technique; temporary vNICs removed after use; minimal forensic evidence | #lateral_movement #defense_evasion #T1021 #T1497 #esxi #vmware #ghost_nic #unc6201 | Jinx (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- UNC6201 created temporary vNICs on existing VMs — removed after use leaving minimal forensic evidence
- Most SOCs don't monitor ESXi host-level VM config changes
- Data sources: ESXi hostd.log, vpxa.log, vCenter task events for VirtualDevice.add
- TTP used since mid-2024 but only publicly reported Feb 2026
