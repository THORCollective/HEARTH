## Why
- The CTI report mentions ransomware like DragonForce and Medusa being deployed after gaining access via SimpleHelp RMM software
- Detecting the specific delivery mechanism of ransomware can help disrupt attacks before encryption and impact occurs
- PowerShell is a common tool used by threat actors to download and execute malicious payloads while blending in with legitimate admin activity
- Recently registered, low-reputation domains are often used to host initial payloads to avoid detection by domain/IP reputation lists
