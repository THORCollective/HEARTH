#H024

Threat actors are using the ClickFix social engineering technique to trick users into copying and pasting malicious PowerShell commands into their system's run dialog, resulting in the execution of the GHOSTPULSE loader and subsequent deployment of the ARECHCLIENT2 info-stealer on the victim's system.

## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it allows threat actors to gain initial access to the system, bypassing many traditional perimeter defenses.
- If successful, the threat actors can deploy the GHOSTPULSE loader and the ARECHCLIENT2 info-stealer, leading to potential data theft and unauthorized remote control over the compromised system.
- This technique has been linked to a larger campaign involving the deployment of various malware and info-stealers, indicating a widespread and ongoing threat.
