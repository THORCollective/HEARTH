# H021

Threat actors are using the undocumented Windows Security Center (WSC) APIs to register a fabricated antivirus product, effectively disabling Windows Defender and creating an environment conducive for subsequent malware deployment and execution. This is achieved by injecting a malicious DLL into the Task Manager process (taskmgr.exe) which then interacts with the WSC API to register itself as a legitimate antivirus product.

## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it allows threat actors to disable Windows Defender, one of the primary security solutions on Windows systems, thereby significantly lowering the barrier for subsequent malware deployment and execution.
- If successful, this technique can lead to a compromised system, data breaches, and potential lateral movement within the network.
- This technique has been associated with the tool "defendnot", which represents a sophisticated approach to bypassing Windows Defender.
