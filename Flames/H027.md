## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as AppleScript provides native system access and can bypass many security controls when delivered through social engineering.
- If successful, this tactic allows threat actors to establish initial foothold on macOS systems in high-value cryptocurrency organizations.
- This behavior has been observed in BlueNoroff's sophisticated social engineering campaigns using deepfake technology and impersonation of legitimate meeting platforms.
