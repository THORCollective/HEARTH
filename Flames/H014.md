## Why

- Detecting Cobalt Strike's use of named pipes for command-and-control (C2) communication significantly enhances an organization's ability to identify and mitigate sophisticated adversary activities.
- By monitoring Sysmon Event IDs 17 and 18, which log pipe creation and access events, security teams can pinpoint the establishment of covert C2 channels that utilize named pipes - a technique often employed by Cobalt Strike for lateral movement and persistence.
- This proactive detection approach enables early identification of malicious activities, facilitating timely response actions to prevent unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and further compromise within the network.
- Implementing such detection mechanisms is crucial for maintaining robust security defenses against advanced persistent threats leveraging tools like Cobalt Strike.
