# H041

Threat actors are using dd commands to write malicious shellcode directly into the memory of legitimate cat processes at specific offsets (0x4012f0 and 0x602820) to bypass Juniper veriexec protection and execute TINYSHELL backdoors on Juniper routers.

Why:
- This technique allows attackers to bypass Juniper's veriexec file integrity protection by injecting malicious code into trusted processes rather than writing unauthorized binaries
- The specific memory locations and process injection technique demonstrates deep knowledge of Juniper OS internals
- Successful execution provides attackers with persistent backdoor access while evading standard detection methods
- This was a key technique used by UNC3886 to maintain long-term access to critical network infrastructure
- The technique is particularly concerning as it targets core routing infrastructure that typically lacks endpoint security controls
