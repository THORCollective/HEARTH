| H045 | Threat actors are using MSHTA.exe to download and execute HTA scripts from hardcoded IP addresses (e.g. http://[IP]/[PORT].hta) which contain Base64-encoded PowerShell reverse shell commands to establish persistent C2 connections. | Command and Scripting Interpreter | Based on ATT&CK technique T1218.005.

## Why
- MSHTA.exe is a native Windows binary that can be abused to execute malicious HTA scripts while bypassing security controls
- The specific pattern of IP/port.hta URLs and Base64 PowerShell payloads is distinctive to this Silent Skimmer campaign
- Successful detection could identify initial access and persistence mechanisms used by this financially-motivated threat actor
- This technique was used by Silent Skimmer to establish backdoor access for payment card theft operations
