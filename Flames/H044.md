## Why
- PowerShell execution of PHP from non-standard locations represents a highly suspicious behavior that may indicate Interlock RAT activity
- The specific command pattern using extension directives and config files is distinctive to this campaign
- This technique serves as the initial execution vector for the Interlock RAT PHP variant
- Successful detection can identify compromises early in the attack chain before lateral movement occurs
- Part of a larger Interlock ransomware campaign using the KongTuke/FileFix delivery mechanism
