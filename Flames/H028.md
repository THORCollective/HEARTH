## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as display state awareness indicates sophisticated operational security and intent to avoid user detection.
- If successful, this tactic allows threat actors to execute malicious activities when users are away, reducing the likelihood of discovery.
- This behavior demonstrates advanced understanding of user behavior patterns and sophisticated evasion techniques.
