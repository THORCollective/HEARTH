# H034

Threat actors are using IDE plugins like "Remote Code Runner" or "REST Client" to launch unauthorized shells, scripts, or network connections from trusted developer tools such as VS Code, PyCharm, or Eclipse to enable persistence, C2 beaconing, or lateral movement on developer endpoints.

## Why
- IDE plugins have extensive access and can execute code, spawn processes, and make network connections
- Malicious plugins can abuse this trust to persist, move laterally, or establish C2 channels
- Developers are high-value targets, so compromising their tooling enables access to source code and sensitive systems
- Plugin-based attacks often blend in with legitimate dev activity and may be missed by standard detections
