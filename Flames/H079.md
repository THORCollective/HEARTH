An adversary is abusing Group Policy Objects for lateral deployment and using bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver techniques to terminate security tools targeting enterprise Active Directory environments to disable defenses before executing ransomware with hybrid encryption.

| H079 | An adversary is abusing Group Policy Objects for lateral deployment and using bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver techniques to terminate security tools targeting enterprise Active Directory environments to disable defenses before executing ransomware with hybrid encryption. | Lateral Movement | CrazyHunter ransomware; GPO abuse looks like legit admin activity; BYOVD to kill EDR; weak AD creds as entry | #lateral_movement #defense_evasion #T1484_001 #T1562_001 #T1106 #byovd #gpo #ransomware #crazyhunter | Jinx (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- BYOVD is increasingly common but many orgs lack vulnerable driver blocklists or kernel-level monitoring
- GPO abuse for ransomware distribution bypasses endpoint-focused detections — it looks like legitimate admin activity
- Multi-stage execution (disable defenses → in-memory payload) leaves minimal disk artifacts
- Weak AD credentials as initial access vector — huntable via authentication log baselines
