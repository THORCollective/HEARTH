# H079

An adversary is reusing hosting infrastructure across multiple C2 frameworks, detectable by correlating IP ranges and hosting providers across framework-specific fingerprints — particularly shared bulletproof hosting providers that appear across SparkRAT, Havoc, and Sliver deployments.

| H079 | An adversary is reusing hosting infrastructure across multiple C2 frameworks, detectable by correlating IP ranges and hosting providers across framework-specific fingerprints — particularly shared bulletproof hosting providers that appear across SparkRAT, Havoc, and Sliver deployments. | Command and Control | Cross-framework infrastructure overlap observed: the same bulletproof hosting providers appear across SparkRAT, Havoc, and Sliver deployments. Pivoting from one framework's confirmed C2 to same-provider IPs discovers related infrastructure across frameworks. | #command_and_control #T1583_003 #T1584_004 #infrastructure #pivot #cross_framework #external_hunting | Jinx & Salem (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- Threat actors often reuse hosting providers — bulletproof hosters serve a finite customer base
- Shared hosting providers observed hosting SparkRAT C2s alongside other C2 frameworks on nearby subnets
- Bulletproof providers (Stark Industries, FlokiNET, Cloudzy, etc.) appear across multiple C2 framework deployments
- Cross-framework pivots find infrastructure that single-framework hunting misses
- This hypothesis enables "hunt once, find many" — a single bulletproof hosting investigation surfaces multiple C2 families
