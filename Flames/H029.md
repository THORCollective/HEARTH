## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as process injection allows malicious code to execute within legitimate processes, evading many security controls.
- If successful, this tactic enables threat actors to hide malicious activity within trusted processes and potentially inherit their privileges.
- This behavior is rare on macOS outside of legitimate development scenarios, making it a high-value detection opportunity.
