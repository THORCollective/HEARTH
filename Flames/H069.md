| H069 | An adversary is abusing the native Windows utility finger.exe by copying and renaming it to a temporary directory to retrieve remote payloads over TCP port 79 targeting enterprise endpoints to establish command and control while evading application controls. | Command and Control | Observed in CrashFix/KongTuke campaign (Jan 2026). finger.exe copied to %TEMP% and renamed to ct.exe to retrieve obfuscated PowerShell payloads. Selectively targets domain-joined machines. Finger protocol (TCP 79) is effectively dead in modern enterprises, making any activity highly anomalous. | #command_and_control #T1105 #T1036_003 #T1218 #finger_exe #lolbin #crashfix | Jinx (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- finger.exe is a native Windows binary that ships with every Windows installation but has virtually no legitimate use in modern enterprise environments — any execution or network connection from this binary is highly anomalous and worth investigating
- Copying and renaming finger.exe to a temp directory (e.g., ct.exe) evades application allowlists and detection rules that key on the original filename, while the renamed binary retains full functionality to retrieve remote content over TCP 79
- Outbound TCP port 79 traffic is rarely monitored or included in firewall egress rules because the finger protocol is considered obsolete — attackers exploit this blind spot to retrieve payloads without triggering common network-based detections
- Hunting for any combination of finger.exe file copies, renamed instances of the binary (by hash), or outbound TCP 79 connections in endpoint and network telemetry provides a high-fidelity, low-noise detection opportunity
