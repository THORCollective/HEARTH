Threat actors are using a counterfeit Zoom installer to deploy SectopRAT, a remote access trojan, as their initial access method to compromise the target's system.

## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it represents the initial access point of the threat actor into the target's system. If undetected, it could lead to further compromise of the system and potentially the entire network.
- The tactical impact of success for the threat actor is significant. Gaining initial access allows them to deploy additional tools, move laterally across the network, and potentially achieve their ultimate objectives such as data exfiltration or system disruption.
- This behavior has been linked to larger campaigns involving SectopRAT and counterfeit software installers, indicating a broader threat landscape that organizations need to be aware of.
