# H-2025-001

Threat actors are using AI-powered autonomous agents to execute network scanning tools like nmap and masscan across thousands of target IP ranges per minute, identifying live hosts and open ports to map organizational attack surfaces without human operator intervention.

## Why
- This represents a fundamental shift in reconnaissance capabilities where AI agents can perform network discovery at speeds impossible for human operators (thousands of requests with multiple per second), dramatically compressing the reconnaissance phase of cyber kill chains
- The autonomous nature of these scans means they can run continuously across multiple targets simultaneously, allowing state-sponsored groups to map 30+ organizations in parallel as demonstrated in this campaign
- Detection of high-velocity, automated network scanning patterns is critical as this phase directly enables subsequent exploitation phases where the AI identifies high-value databases and security vulnerabilities
- Traditional rate-limiting and anomaly detection may fail against AI-orchestrated scans that can intelligently vary timing, source IPs, and scan patterns to evade detection while maintaining unprecedented speed
- This technique was central to Phase 2 of the documented Chinese state-sponsored campaign where Claude Code autonomously inspected target infrastructure in a fraction of the time human teams would require
