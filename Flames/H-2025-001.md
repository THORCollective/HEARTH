## Why
- The KimJongRAT malware is a persistent and evolving threat that has been actively developed since at least 2019. Detecting its latest infection vectors is critical.
- Abuse of legitimate CDNs to host malware is an increasingly common tactic to evade network security controls. Identifying malicious downloads from CDNs can catch intrusions early.
- PowerShell is a powerful tool frequently abused by attackers. Monitoring for suspicious PowerShell usage, especially web downloads, can surface malicious activity.
