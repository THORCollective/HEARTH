# H-2025-001

Threat actors are using the MSHTA utility to execute malicious HTA files, which are disguised as benign document files and sent as email attachments, to establish initial access on targeted Windows systems.

## Why
- Detecting the use of MSHTA to execute malicious HTA files is critical as this technique is commonly used by adversaries for initial access, and can lead to further stages of the attack lifecycle such as execution, persistence, and lateral movement.
- If successful, the threat actors can gain a foothold on the system, enabling them to further their malicious activities such as deploying malware, stealing sensitive data, or moving laterally within the network.
- The use of this technique can be linked to various threat campaigns which leverage spear phishing emails with malicious attachments for initial access.
