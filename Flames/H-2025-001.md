Threat actors are using a Python-based remote access trojan (RAT) called "PylangGhost" to target Windows systems of employees with experience in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. The actors trick users into downloading the trojan by creating fake job interview sites and instructing users to copy, paste, and execute a command to allegedly install required video drivers.

## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it allows threat actors to gain initial access to the target system and execute commands remotely, leading to potential data theft or further system compromise.
- The successful execution of this technique can lead to the compromise of sensitive information related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, which can have significant financial implications.
- This technique is part of a larger campaign by the threat actor group Famous Chollima, which has been very active and is known for its well-documented campaigns.
