Threat actors are deploying SOCKS proxy servers on compromised developer workstations by executing WebSocket-based proxy modules that listen on dynamically assigned ports, enabling attackers to route malicious traffic through corporate networks and bypass perimeter security controls.

## Why
- GlassWorm's ZOMBI module transforms every infected developer workstation into a node in a criminal proxy infrastructure, allowing attackers to route traffic through trusted corporate IP addresses
- Developer workstations typically have elevated access to internal systems, source code repositories, and production environments, making them high-value proxy nodes for lateral movement and data exfiltration
- SOCKS proxies on internal machines bypass traditional perimeter defenses since the traffic originates from legitimate, trusted endpoints inside the network
- This technique enables attackers to anonymize their activities by routing attacks through victim infrastructure rather than their own IP addresses
- The GlassWorm campaign demonstrates active exploitation of this technique with C2 infrastructure (217.69.3.218) currently operational and serving proxy deployment payloads
- Detection of unauthorized proxy services is critical as they often precede more damaging attacks like credential theft, internal reconnaissance, and data exfiltration
