## Why
- FamousSparrow APT group is actively using PowerShell web requests to download malicious payloads as part of their initial access
- This technique allows them to bypass network security controls by using legitimate PowerShell commands
- The specific IP and port combination provides a high-fidelity detection opportunity
- This behavior was observed in recent compromises of financial sector organizations
- Successful detection could prevent the deployment of the SparrowDoor backdoor
