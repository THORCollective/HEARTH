# H-2025-001

CTI Report:

Our intelligence sources have identified a new campaign by an unknown threat actor targeting financial institutions. The actor is using spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain initial access. The attachments contain macros that, when enabled, execute a PowerShell command to download a second-stage payload from a remote server. This payload is a custom backdoor that communicates with the C2 server over HTTP. The backdoor has capabilities to download and execute additional payloads, upload files, and execute arbitrary commands. The actor is using this backdoor to move laterally within the network, targeting systems running the SWIFT financial messaging software. The actor's objective appears to be to gain access to the SWIFT systems and manipulate financial transactions.

Threat actors are using spear-phishing emails with malicious macro-enabled attachments to execute a PowerShell command that downloads a custom backdoor from a remote server, with the immediate tactical goal of gaining initial access to the network of financial institutions and specifically targeting systems running the SWIFT financial messaging software.

## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it represents the initial access vector used by the threat actor. Stopping the attack at this stage would prevent further compromise of the network.
- The tactical impact of success is high. If the threat actor gains access to the SWIFT systems, they could manipulate financial transactions, leading to significant financial loss for the targeted institution.
- This behavior is linked to a larger campaign targeting financial institutions, indicating a potentially widespread threat.
