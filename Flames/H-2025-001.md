## Why
- The Citrix Bleed 2 vulnerability allows attackers to bypass MFA protections and hijack user sessions, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.
- Successful exploitation provides attackers with a powerful initial access vector to infiltrate networks, move laterally, and conduct further malicious activities. 
- The original Citrix Bleed vulnerability was widely exploited by ransomware gangs and APT groups, suggesting Citrix Bleed 2 is likely to be rapidly weaponized as well.
