## Why
- Iranian APT groups like APT34 and APT35 have a history of targeting U.S. energy sector networks
- Gaining initial access via phishing enables adversaries to establish a foothold for further exploitation of ICS/OT systems
- Successful compromise could allow disruption of critical energy infrastructure amid heightened geopolitical tensions
