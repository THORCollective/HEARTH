## Why
- OAuth consent phishing is a stealthy way for attackers to gain persistent, legitimate-looking access to sensitive cloud data and accounts
- Malicious OAuth grants can bypass MFA and allow long-term access even after password changes
- Abusing OAuth for initial access and persistence has become increasingly popular in recent campaigns
