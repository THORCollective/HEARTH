# H-2025-001
Our intelligence sources have identified a new threat actor group that has been targeting financial institutions across the globe. The group, which we are tracking as "FIN7", has been observed using a variety of techniques to gain initial access to their targets, including spear-phishing and exploiting software vulnerabilities.

One of their most distinctive TTPs is the use of a PowerShell-based tool called "PowerSniff" to conduct internal reconnaissance once they have gained a foothold in the network. PowerSniff is used to enumerate system information, running processes, and network connections on compromised hosts, which helps the group identify high-value targets for lateral movement and data exfiltration.

# H-2025-001

Threat actors are using the PowerShell-based tool PowerSniff to enumerate system information, running processes, and network connections on compromised hosts within financial institutions to identify high-value targets for lateral movement and data exfiltration.

## Why
- Detecting the use of PowerSniff is crucial as it is a key tool used by FIN7 for internal reconnaissance, which directly supports their objectives of lateral movement and data exfiltration.
- Successful detection can disrupt the adversary's operations by preventing them from identifying high-value targets within the network.
- This behavior is linked to the larger FIN7 campaign targeting financial institutions globally.
