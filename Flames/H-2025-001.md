## Why
- WMI queries for network configuration information are commonly used by attackers to understand network topology and identify potential targets for lateral movement
- This technique provides adversaries with valuable intelligence about internal network structure, DNS servers, and network segments
- The information gathered enables more targeted and effective lateral movement attempts
- This discovery technique is often seen in the early stages of APT campaigns before lateral movement begins
