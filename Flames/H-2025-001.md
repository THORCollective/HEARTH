## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it allows threat actors to cover their tracks and make it more difficult for incident response teams to analyze the attack.
- If successful, this tactic can significantly impede the ability of defenders to understand the full scope of an attack, potentially leading to incomplete remediation efforts.
- This behavior has been observed in conjunction with the deployment of the CyberLock ransomware, indicating it may be part of larger, coordinated campaigns.
