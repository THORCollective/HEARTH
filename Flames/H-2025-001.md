Threat actors are using compiled AppleScript (.scpt) files with fake document extensions like .docx.scpt and .pptx.scpt, combined with custom icons stored in resource forks, to trick users into executing malicious scripts via Script Editor.app and bypass Gatekeeper quarantine restrictions on macOS systems.

## Why
- This technique directly bypasses macOS Gatekeeper protections, which is critical since Apple removed the "right-click and open" override in August 2024, forcing attackers to adopt new methods
- The technique has migrated from APT groups (BlueNoroff) to commodity malware families like Odyssey Stealer and MacSync Stealer, indicating widespread adoption and increased threat surface
- Files delivered via this method can execute quarantined scripts without triggering Gatekeeper warnings, providing a direct path to initial access and execution
- The use of custom icons and double extensions (.docx.scpt, .pptx.scpt) makes these files highly convincing to end users, increasing successful execution rates
- Multiple samples show zero detections on VirusTotal, indicating a significant detection gap across security vendors
