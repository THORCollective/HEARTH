## Why
- Detecting the misuse of legitimate tools like PsExec is crucial as adversaries often leverage them to blend in with normal administrative activities, making their malicious activities harder to detect.
- Successful deployment of ransomware can lead to significant business disruption, data loss, and financial damage. Early detection of such activities can help in mitigating the impact.
- This behavior is linked to larger campaigns involving the use of PsExec for lateral movement and ransomware deployment, indicating a common TTP among certain threat actors.
