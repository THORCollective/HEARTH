Adversaries are using USB devices with malicious payloads, such as Rubber Ducky, to gain initial access to air-gapped OT facilities and ICS networks.

## Why
- USB devices can be an effective way for adversaries to bridge air gaps and compromise isolated OT/ICS networks
- Malicious USB payloads like Rubber Ducky can rapidly execute attacker commands on a system with no user interaction required
- Detecting rogue USB devices is critical for preventing adversaries from establishing an initial foothold in secured environments
