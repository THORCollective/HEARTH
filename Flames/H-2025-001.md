## Why
- JSFireTruck obfuscation makes malicious JavaScript code difficult to analyze and detect
- Compromising legitimate websites as watering holes allows threat actors to target many victims
- Redirecting search engine traffic ensures a steady stream of targets to malicious destinations 
- Malicious URLs can lead to malware downloads, phishing, malvertising, and other threats
