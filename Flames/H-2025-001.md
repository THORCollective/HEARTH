## Why
- Detecting this behavior is important as it allows threat actors to gain persistent access to a victim's email account, potentially leading to the compromise of sensitive information.
- The success of this tactic can lead to further exploitation of the compromised account, including the potential for lateral movement within an organization.
- This behavior has been linked to state-sponsored cyber threat actors, indicating a high level of sophistication and potential impact.
