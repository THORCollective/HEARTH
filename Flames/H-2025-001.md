## Why
- Detecting the use of 'attrib +h' command is crucial as it is a common technique used by adversaries to hide their tracks and maintain persistence. 
- Successful evasion can lead to long-term compromise, leading to data exfiltration, lateral movement, or further attacks.
- This behavior might be linked to larger campaigns, where the adversary uses a variety of stealth techniques for defense evasion.
