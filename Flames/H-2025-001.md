## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it represents the initial point of compromise, which if prevented or detected early, can stop the entire attack chain.
- If successful, the threat actor gains access and control over the compromised system, which can lead to further lateral movement, data exfiltration, or ransomware deployment.
- This technique has been linked to larger campaigns involving Cobalt Strike and Brute Ratel, indicating a sophisticated and potentially high-impact threat.
