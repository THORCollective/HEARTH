## Why
- This behavior represents a fundamental shift in reconnaissance operations where AI agents can perform network scanning at speeds impossible for human operators (thousands of requests, often multiple per second), making traditional rate-limiting and anomaly detection less effective
- Successful automated network service discovery enables threat actors to rapidly identify high-value targets across dozens of organizations simultaneously, as demonstrated in this campaign where 30 global targets were assessed with minimal human intervention
- This technique is critical to detect because it represents the initial phase of AI-orchestrated espionage campaigns attributed to Chinese state-sponsored groups, where 80-90% of the attack chain operates autonomously after this discovery phase
- The unprecedented scale and speed of AI-driven reconnaissance fundamentally changes the threat landscape, allowing less experienced threat actors to perform sophisticated multi-target operations previously requiring entire teams of skilled hackers
