| [Leave blank] | Threat actors are using the undocumented Windows Security Center (WSC) APIs to register a fabricated antivirus product, which inherently forces Windows Defender into a disabled state, allowing for the execution of subsequent malware on Windows systems. | Defense Evasion | Based on ATT&CK technique T1562.001, using the tool "defendnot" | #DefenseEvasion #T1562.001 #defendnot | [hearth-auto-intel](https://github.com/THORCollective/HEARTH) |

## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it allows threat actors to disable Windows Defender, a primary security solution for many Windows systems. This creates an environment where additional malicious activities can proceed without interference.
- If successful, this technique can lead to a significant compromise of the target system, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system damage, or further lateral movement within the network.
- This technique has been linked to the tool "defendnot", which represents a sophisticated approach to bypassing Windows Defender. It demonstrates how undocumented APIs intended for use by legitimate security vendors can be reverse-engineered and exploited.
