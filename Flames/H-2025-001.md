## Why
- The FamousSparrow APT group uses this specific registry key name "K7Soft" to persist their SparrowDoor backdoor
- This technique allows the malware to automatically execute when users log in
- The key name attempts to masquerade as legitimate K7 Antivirus software
- Successful detection could identify compromised systems and disrupt the APT group's persistence mechanism
- Part of larger Chinese cyber espionage campaigns targeting financial and government sectors
