# H-2025-001
Our threat intelligence sources have identified a new campaign by an unknown threat actor. The actor is using a multi-stage attack to compromise corporate networks. The initial infection vector is a spear-phishing email containing a malicious Microsoft Word document. Once opened, the document uses macros to download and execute a PowerShell script from a remote server. This script then downloads a second-stage payload, which is a custom backdoor that communicates with a command and control (C2) server over HTTP.

The backdoor has several capabilities, including file exfiltration, remote command execution, and lateral movement. However, one of its most notable features is its use of the "Scheduled Task" technique for persistence. The backdoor creates a scheduled task that runs every hour, executing a command that checks for updates from the C2 server and downloads any new payloads.

# H-2025-001

Threat actors are creating hourly scheduled tasks named "UpdateCheck" to execute a command that communicates with their C2 server, allowing them to maintain persistence and download updates or new payloads on compromised corporate networks.

## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it allows threat actors to maintain a foothold in the compromised network, potentially leading to further exploitation and data exfiltration.
- The success of this technique could enable the threat actors to update their tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) on the fly, making their activities harder to detect and counter.
- This behavior is part of a larger campaign involving spear-phishing and multi-stage attacks, indicating a sophisticated and determined adversary.
