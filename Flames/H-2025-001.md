## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it allows threat actors to execute commands and control systems remotely, leading to potential data theft, system damage, and further lateral movement within the network.
- The successful execution of this technique can lead to the compromise of sensitive data and critical systems, potentially causing significant operational and financial impact.
- This behavior has been linked to larger campaigns involving ransomware deployment and data exfiltration, making it a critical detection point for preventing extensive damage.
