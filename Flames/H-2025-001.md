Threat actors are establishing persistent backdoor access by deploying Hidden Virtual Network Computing (HVNC) servers that create invisible virtual desktop sessions running outside the user's visible desktop environment, enabling attackers to perform reconnaissance, credential theft, and lateral movement activities without triggering visual alerts or appearing in standard process monitoring tools on compromised developer workstations.

## Why
- HVNC represents one of the most sophisticated remote access capabilities in the GlassWorm malware, providing attackers with complete invisible control over compromised systems while bypassing traditional detection mechanisms that rely on visible windows or standard process enumeration
- This technique enables attackers to leverage existing authenticated sessions in browsers and applications to access corporate resources, internal tools, email, and source code repositories without requiring additional credential theft or authentication bypass
- The invisible nature of HVNC sessions means attackers can conduct extensive reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and lateral movement activities for extended periods without alerting users or triggering security monitoring tools that depend on user-visible indicators
- Detection of HVNC deployment is critical for identifying advanced persistent threats targeting developer environments, as these systems typically have elevated access to source code repositories, build systems, and production infrastructure
- GlassWorm's use of HVNC demonstrates the evolution of supply chain attacks beyond simple credential theft toward establishing persistent, invisible command and control channels within enterprise networks
