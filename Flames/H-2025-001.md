## Why
- Compressing data allows threat actors to package up large amounts of sensitive information into easy-to-transfer ZIP files
- Detecting the use of PowerShell to create suspicious ZIP archives can catch attackers in the act of preparing to steal data
- The KimJongRAT malware specifically uses PowerShell's Compress-Archive to bundle up files like browser data before sending to the C2 server
