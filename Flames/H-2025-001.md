Adversaries are exploiting credential harvesting tools to extract usernames and passwords from compromised systems' memory, registry hives, and credential stores, enabling lateral movement to high-privilege accounts across enterprise networks.

## Why
- The reported campaign explicitly involved harvesting credentials as a critical phase of the attack, allowing adversaries to gain further access to target systems and identify the highest-privilege accounts for exploitation
- Credential harvesting directly enables lateral movement and privilege escalation, which are essential for achieving espionage objectives and maintaining persistent access to sensitive data
- This technique was automated at scale in the campaign, with AI agents performing credential extraction across multiple targets simultaneously, making it a high-impact detection opportunity
- Detecting credential dumping activity can disrupt attack chains before adversaries establish backdoors or exfiltrate sensitive data, providing a critical intervention point
