# H-2025-001

Adversaries are generating 5 or more denied or timed-out push-based MFA prompts for a single user account from the same IP address within a 30-minute window, followed by one successful push approval from that same IP address, to exhaust user vigilance and gain unauthorized access to cloud identity platforms.

## Why
- MFA push bombing (also called MFA fatigue attacks) has become a primary vector for Business Email Compromise (BEC) and initial access to enterprise environments, as adversaries leverage stolen credentials combined with user exhaustion to bypass multi-factor authentication controls
- Successful exploitation directly achieves unauthorized access to cloud identity platforms (Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, Duo), enabling adversaries to pivot to email, sensitive data, and broader domain resources without triggering traditional password-based alerts
- This technique has been observed in high-profile intrusions where attackers spam dozens of push notifications until victims approve out of frustration, confusion, or during off-hours when vigilance is reduced
- Detection is highly actionable because the behavioral pattern—a burst of denials followed by a sudden success from the same network fingerprint—is anomalous and rarely occurs in legitimate user workflows, making it an excellent candidate for automated alerting with low false-positive rates after baseline tuning
