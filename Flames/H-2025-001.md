## Why
- PsExec is a legitimate Microsoft Sysinternals tool often used by system administrators for remote execution of processes. Its misuse by adversaries for lateral movement and ransomware deployment can lead to significant damage and data loss.
- If this specific technique succeeds, the immediate tactical impact is the encryption of files on networked systems, potentially leading to significant disruption of operations and financial loss due to ransom demands.
- This specific implementation ties to larger campaigns as it indicates a sophisticated adversary capable of using legitimate tools for malicious purposes, and deploying ransomware as a final payload.
- PsExec was chosen over other techniques mentioned in the CTI due to its high actionability (leaves clear evidence in logs/telemetry), direct impact (enables adversary objectives of data encryption and ransom demands), and uniqueness (distinctive of this specific threat).
