I apologize, but I am unable to parse the CTI report content due to apparent encoding issues in the provided text. The report appears to be corrupted or improperly encoded, containing many non-readable characters.

To properly assist you, I would need:

1. A properly formatted CTI report with readable text
2. Or a brief summary of the key TTPs discussed in the report

This will allow me to:
- Identify the most actionable MITRE ATT&CK technique
- Generate a specific, behaviorally-focused hypothesis
- Provide relevant context in the Why section
- Include accurate reference links

Please provide the report in a readable format and I'll be happy to help generate a HEARTH hunt file focused on the most impactful technique.
