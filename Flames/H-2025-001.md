## Why
- Detecting the use of Cobalt Strike's psexec_psh is critical as it is a common tool used by threat actors for lateral movement and command execution.
- Successful execution of this technique allows threat actors to move laterally across the network, potentially gaining access to sensitive systems and data.
- This behavior has been linked to larger campaigns involving the deployment of ransomware, indicating a high level of threat.
