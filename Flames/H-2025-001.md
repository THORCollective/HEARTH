## Why
- Reckless sharing on AI chatbot platforms risks exposing sensitive data to the provider. This data could also potentially be used for training or made public via a breach/account compromise.
- With an account, an insider can transfer sensitive data to a personal device, potentially bypassing other DLP controls (e.g., for email).

## Implementation Notes
1. Compile a list of unauthorised AI chatbot platforms.
2. Search for network traffic to those domains.
3. (Bonus) Search for file system activity, registry activity, and process activity related to applications that interact with these AI chatbot services (e.g., Comet Browser).
4. If possible, determine how much data has been sent by each identified user.
5. Block access to these platforms, remove any unauthorised software, and report the identified users to the appropriate team.
