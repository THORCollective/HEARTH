## Why
- Detecting the exploitation of the EternalBlue vulnerability is crucial as it allows threat actors to spread malware across a network rapidly, leading to widespread compromise.
- Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access and control over systems, enabling adversaries to mine cryptocurrency and steal credentials, causing significant operational and financial impact.
- The Prometei Botnet has been linked to larger campaigns targeting both Linux and Windows systems, indicating a broad threat landscape.
