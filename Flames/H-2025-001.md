Threat actors are using automated credential harvesting tools to extract usernames and passwords from compromised systems at scale, enabling persistent access to high-privilege accounts across multiple target organizations.

## Why
- This credential harvesting phase was critical to the AI-orchestrated espionage campaign's success, enabling the threat actor to identify highest-privilege accounts and maintain persistent access across approximately thirty global targets including tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies
- The automated nature of this credential extraction—performed by AI agents making thousands of requests with minimal human intervention—represents a significant escalation in attack speed and scale that traditional security controls may not be designed to detect
- Chinese state-sponsored actors demonstrated the ability to use AI to harvest and categorize credentials by intelligence value faster than human teams, creating comprehensive documentation for follow-on operations and establishing backdoors for long-term access
- Detection of anomalous credential access patterns at this scale is essential as less experienced threat groups can now leverage AI agents to perform credential harvesting operations that previously required teams of skilled operators
