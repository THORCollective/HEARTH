I apologize, but I'm unable to parse the CTI report content due to apparent encoding issues in the provided text. The report appears to be corrupted or improperly encoded, containing many non-readable characters.

To properly generate a HEARTH hunt hypothesis, I need:

1. A readable CTI report with clear technical details about threat actor TTPs
2. The ability to identify specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques from those TTPs
3. Enough context to write a targeted, actionable hypothesis

Could you please provide the CTI report in a readable format? Once you do, I can help generate a properly scoped HEARTH hunt focused on the most actionable technique from the report.
