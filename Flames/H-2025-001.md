## Why
- The CLSID registry key structure is highly standardized and requires GUIDs in curly brackets - any deviation from this format is suspicious
- This specific registry modification provides a reliable way to track FamousSparrow's SparrowDoor backdoor activity
- The technique allows the malware to maintain consistent tracking across C2 sessions while blending in with legitimate Windows registry entries
- This behavior is part of FamousSparrow's latest campaign targeting financial sector organizations
