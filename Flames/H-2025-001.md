## Why
- AppleScript can be abused to download and execute malicious code on macOS systems
- Using fake Zoom support pages exploits user trust to deceive victims into running malware
- Encrypting the payload helps evade network-based malware detection 
- This specific TTP was used by the sophisticated BlueNoroff APT group to target cryptocurrency organizations
