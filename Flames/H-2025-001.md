## Why
- Citrix NetScaler Gateway is widely used for secure remote access. Exploiting vulnerabilities in it provides attackers an initial foothold.
- Bypassing MFA allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users and access sensitive systems and data.
- Session hijacking enables persistent, stealthy access even after users log out. This facilitates further malicious activity.
- Similar Citrix vulnerabilities like Citrix Bleed have been exploited by ransomware and APT groups for large-scale attacks.
