CTI REPORT:

Our intelligence sources have identified a new campaign by an unknown threat actor. The actor is using a novel technique to evade detection and maintain persistence on compromised systems. They are leveraging the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) system to execute malicious PowerShell scripts. Specifically, they are creating WMI Event Filters and Consumers to trigger the execution of these scripts when specific system conditions are met, such as a user logging in or a system reboot. This technique allows the actor to maintain persistence on the system and execute their malicious payloads without being detected by traditional security controls.

## Why
- Detecting this behavior is important as it allows threat actors to maintain persistence on compromised systems and execute malicious payloads without being detected by traditional security controls.
- If successful, the threat actor can maintain a foothold on the system, potentially leading to further compromise and data exfiltration.
- This technique has been linked to a larger campaign by an unknown threat actor, indicating a potentially widespread and ongoing threat.
