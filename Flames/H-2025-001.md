## Why
- Malicious packages often exfiltrate data to attacker infrastructure using Discord webhooks to blend in with normal traffic
- If successful, this allows adversaries to deliver malware to victim machines while bypassing common network security controls 
- This behavior has been observed in recent campaigns abusing open source software supply chains and developer tools
