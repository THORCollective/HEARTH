Threat actors are crafting TCP SYN packets with anomalous header values like 20-byte header length, zero window size, and zero initial sequence number to scan networks and exploit services while evading detection.

## Why
- Detecting crafted TCP SYN packets with anomalous header values can reveal network scanning and attempts to exploit services
- Successful scanning enables adversaries to map the network, identify potential targets, and find vulnerable services to compromise  
- Network scanning is a common precursor to many targeted intrusions and commodity malware infections
