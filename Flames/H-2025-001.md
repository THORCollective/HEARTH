## Why
- Exploiting ICS device vulnerabilities enables adversaries to directly impact the physical processes these systems control
- Successful exploitation could allow disruption or manipulation of critical services like power, water, manufacturing, etc.
- Iranian APTs have a history of targeting U.S. critical infrastructure and may leverage ICS exploits in retaliation for recent events
