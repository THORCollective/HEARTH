# H-2025-001

CTI REPORT:

Our threat intelligence sources have reported a new campaign by an unidentified threat group targeting financial institutions. The attackers are using spear-phishing emails to deliver a malicious Microsoft Word document. Once opened, the document exploits a vulnerability in Word's macro feature to download and execute a PowerShell script. This script then uses the "Invoke-Mimikatz" cmdlet to dump credentials from the memory of the compromised system. The dumped credentials are exfiltrated to a command and control server via an encrypted HTTPS connection.

---

Hypothesis:

Threat actors are exploiting Microsoft Word's macro feature to download and execute a PowerShell script that uses the "Invoke-Mimikatz" cmdlet to dump credentials from the memory of systems within financial institutions, with the immediate tactical goal of exfiltrating these credentials to a command and control server.

## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it allows the threat actors to gain access to sensitive credentials, which can be used for further lateral movement within the network or for fraudulent financial transactions.
- The tactical impact of success for the threat actors includes unauthorized access to sensitive systems and potential financial loss for the targeted institution.
- This behavior is linked to a larger campaign targeting financial institutions, increasing the potential impact and making it a high priority for detection.
