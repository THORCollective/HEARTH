## Why
- PsExec is a legitimate Microsoft Sysinternals tool often used by system administrators for executing processes on other systems, making its malicious use harder to detect.
- If the deployment of BlackSuit ransomware succeeds, it can lead to significant data loss and disruption of operations, as the ransomware encrypts files on the infected systems.
- The use of PsExec for lateral movement and ransomware deployment is a common tactic in various cyber attack campaigns, indicating a potential link to larger, organized threat groups.
- The choice of PsExec over other methods may be due to its effectiveness and the difficulty in distinguishing its legitimate use from malicious activity.
