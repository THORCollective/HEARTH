## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it allows threat actors to gain control over critical systems, potentially leading to data theft, system disruption, or further lateral movement within the network.
- If successful, the threat actors can manipulate the compromised system to their advantage, potentially leading to significant financial and reputational damage for the targeted organization.
- This technique has been linked to larger campaigns targeting the financial sector, indicating a strategic focus on high-value targets.
