## Why
- Detecting the use of Cobalt Strike's psexec_psh module is critical as it is a common tool used by threat actors for lateral movement within a network. Its detection can help to identify compromised systems and prevent further spread of the attack.
- If successful, the threat actor can gain control over multiple systems within the network, potentially leading to significant data loss or disruption of operations.
- This behavior has been linked to larger campaigns involving the use of counterfeit Zoom installers and various types of malware, indicating a sophisticated and coordinated attack strategy.
