# H-2025-001

Adversaries are invalidating active user sessions and forcing reauthentication by revoking refresh tokens or session cookies through compromised administrative accounts, immediately followed by MFA prompt generation from the attacker's IP address, to bypass existing session protections and trigger a fresh authentication flow they can intercept.

## Why
- Session revocation followed by immediate authentication attempts from a different IP is a sophisticated evasion technique that bypasses existing session-based security controls and forces users into a vulnerable authentication state
- This behavior indicates an adversary has already gained some level of administrative access and is using it to create authentication opportunities they can exploit through MFA fatigue or social engineering
- Detecting forced session invalidation patterns helps identify compromised administrative accounts before they can be used for broader tenant takeover or Business Email Compromise (BEC) campaigns
- This technique is particularly dangerous because it appears as legitimate administrative action in logs, making it difficult to distinguish from normal IT support activities without correlating the subsequent authentication attempts
