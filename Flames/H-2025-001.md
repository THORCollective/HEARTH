# H-2025-001

Our threat intelligence team has recently discovered a new campaign by an unidentified threat group targeting financial institutions. The attackers are leveraging spear-phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office documents attached. These documents contain embedded macros that, when enabled, execute a PowerShell command to download and execute a second-stage payload from a remote server. The payload is a custom backdoor that allows the attackers to gain control over the infected system.

Threat actors are leveraging spear-phishing emails with malicious Microsoft Office documents that contain embedded macros. When these macros are enabled, they execute a PowerShell command to download and execute a second-stage payload from a remote server, allowing the attackers to gain control over the infected system.

## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it allows the attackers to gain control over the infected system, potentially leading to further lateral movement, data exfiltration, or disruption of services.
- The success of this tactic could lead to significant financial and reputational damage for the targeted institutions.
- This behavior is linked to a larger campaign targeting financial institutions, indicating a potentially significant threat to this sector.
