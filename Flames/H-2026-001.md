## Why
The Chinese state-sponsored group known as Lotus Blossom compromised the shared hosting server used for the Notepad++ website and then maintained credential access for internal hosting services over a period of ~6 months. This allowed auto updates to be redirected to download malicious binaries, leading to hands-on keyboard activity. Only certain users were targeted, with known victims from Southeast Asia and Central America. However, this marks a significant supply chain attack, with security failures from both the Notepad++ application (lack of authenticity) and the hosting provider.

## Implementation Notes
Period of compromise: June through 2nd of December 2025

Search ideas:

- Known IPs/domains observed in attacks.
- Known file/directory names observed in attacks (e.g., `update.exe`, `AutoUpdater.exe`, and `install.exe` in `%TEMP%`).
- `gup.exe` making network connections other than to `notepad-plus-plus.org`, `github.com`, and `githubusercontent.com`.
- `gup.exe` files written, comparing hashes to those published by Notepad++ on GitHub.
- `gup.exe` child processes other than `explorer.exe` and `npp.<version>.Installer.exe`/`npp.<version>.Installer.<arch>.exe`.
- Discovery command lines like `cmd`, `/c`, `>`, and `.txt` combined with any of `whoami`, `tasklist`, `systeminfo`, or `netstat`.
- Use of `curl.exe` with command lines containing `-F`, `file=`, and `.txt`. Alternatively, `--user-agent "http` and `.txt`.
