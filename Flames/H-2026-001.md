Adversaries are modifying the VIB acceptance level on ESXi hosts using esxcli commands to lower system integrity enforcement from VMwareCertified or VMwareAccepted to CommunitySupported, enabling the installation of unsigned or malicious vSphere Installation Bundles that can establish persistence or deploy backdoors.

## Why
- Lowering VIB acceptance levels is a critical pre-requisite for attackers to install malicious kernel modules, backdoors, or ransomware components on ESXi hypervisors, directly weakening the system's code integrity protections
- This technique enables adversaries to bypass VMware's signature verification mechanisms, allowing them to deploy unsigned software that would normally be blocked, which is frequently observed in ESXi-targeted ransomware campaigns
- ESXi environments are often under-monitored and a single compromised hypervisor can lead to organization-wide impact, as demonstrated by the MGM Resorts incident where over 100 hypervisors were encrypted resulting in $100 million in losses
- Detecting VIB acceptance level tampering provides an early warning indicator before malicious software installation occurs, giving defenders a critical opportunity to prevent ransomware deployment or persistence establishment
