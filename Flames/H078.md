## Why

- APT28 weaponized CVE-2026-21509 within 24h of disclosure — zero-click OLE execution via spearphishing from compromised gov email accounts
- Outlook VBA backdoor (NotDoor) + modified Covenant implant = post-exploitation lives entirely in-memory with no disk artifacts
- C2 traffic blends into legitimate cloud storage (filen.io) — most network monitors won't flag it
- COM hijacking for persistence is rarely baselined — detection gap in most EDR deployments
