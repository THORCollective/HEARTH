| H066 | An adversary is deploying malicious browser extensions that impersonate AI productivity tools to steal session tokens and conversation data from AI platforms targeting users of ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and similar services to harvest credentials and exfiltrate sensitive prompt data. | Credential Access | Multiple campaigns in late 2025/early 2026 — 16+ malicious Chrome/Edge extensions stealing ChatGPT session tokens, 900K+ users affected. Extensions clone legitimate tools and add token/conversation exfil under the guise of "analytics data" collection. | #credential_access #T1528 #T1185 #browser_extension #ai_tokens #chatgpt #session_hijack | Jinx (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- Malicious browser extensions requesting broad permissions can access session tokens, authentication cookies, and full conversation content from AI platform tabs without users noticing any change in extension behavior
- AI platform sessions contain sensitive data beyond just credentials — proprietary code, internal documents pasted into prompts, strategic discussions, and customer data flowing through AI assistants represent high-value exfiltration targets
- Hunting for unauthorized or recently installed browser extensions that interact with AI platform domains (chat.openai.com, deepseek.com, claude.ai) in endpoint telemetry can surface compromised workstations before session tokens are abused
- Organizations often lack visibility into which browser extensions employees install, and AI-themed extensions are rapidly proliferating — creating a growing blind spot where credential harvesting can hide behind legitimate-looking productivity tools
