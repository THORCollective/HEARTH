## Why

- First documented malicious Outlook add-in in the wild — 4,000+ credentials stolen via abandoned "AgreeTo" add-in whose Vercel URL was reclaimed by attacker
- Office add-ins load content live from developer URLs with NO re-review after initial approval — "approve once, trust forever" gap
- Add-ins with ReadWriteItem permissions can silently read/modify ALL user emails — credential theft was the least damaging option
- Same attack class as browser extension takeovers and npm package hijacking, but inside the M365 trust boundary
