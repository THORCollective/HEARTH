# H076

An adversary is operating Sliver C2 HTTPS listeners identifiable through anomalous X.509 certificate characteristics — specifically the presence of a `streetAddress` field in self-signed certificates with `CN=localhost` and country codes limited to US, CA, or JP — combined with minimal HTTP 404 responses lacking standard server headers.

| H076 | An adversary is operating Sliver C2 HTTPS listeners identifiable through anomalous X.509 certificate characteristics — specifically the presence of a `streetAddress` field in self-signed certificates with `CN=localhost` and country codes limited to US, CA, or JP — combined with minimal HTTP 404 responses lacking standard server headers. | Command and Control | Novel detection: Sliver's `randomSubject()` always includes `streetAddress` in certs — near-unique among C2 frameworks. Combined with empty 404 responses (no Server header, no X-headers), catches HTTPS listeners invisible to existing Shodan product tags. Previously published JARM-based detection is now INVALID — the hardcoded cipher was removed from current Sliver code. | #command_and_control #T1573_002 #T1071_001 #sliver #c2 #x509 #certificate #external_hunting | Jinx & Salem (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- Sliver is the most popular open-source C2 framework, used by both red teams and threat actors (APT29, DEV-0237, multiple ransomware groups)
- Published JARM-based detection is now INVALID — the hardcoded cipher was removed from current Sliver code
- Many active Sliver HTTPS listeners are invisible to existing Shodan detection methods (no daemon port exposed)
- The `streetAddress` field in self-signed X.509 certificates is a near-unique Sliver discriminator — almost no other software populates this field
- Sliver hardcodes exactly 3 countries (US, CA, JP) in cert generation — zero outliers observed across hundreds of certs
- "Detection by absence": Sliver's HTTP 404 response has NO Server header, NO X-Powered-By, NO Pragma — the absence of standard headers IS the fingerprint
- Validated against Sliver source code (`server/certs/subject.go`) and live infrastructure
