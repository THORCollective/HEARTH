## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems in the cloud environment.
- If successful, the threat actors can escalate their privileges, potentially gaining full control over the cloud environment and enabling them to exfiltrate sensitive data.
- This technique has been observed in larger campaigns targeting cloud environments, indicating a broader threat landscape.
