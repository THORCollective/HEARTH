# H056

Adversaries are invalidating active user sessions by revoking OAuth refresh tokens or session cookies through compromised administrative accounts in Microsoft Entra ID, forcing users to reauthenticate and triggering MFA prompts that attackers can then spam to gain persistent access to cloud applications.

## Why
- Session invalidation via administrative token revocation is a precursor to MFA push bombing attacks, allowing adversaries to force fresh authentication flows they can intercept or fatigue-approve
- Compromised administrative accounts with token revocation privileges enable attackers to systematically invalidate legitimate user sessions across an entire tenant, creating windows for credential replay and session hijacking
- This technique is particularly dangerous in Business Email Compromise (BEC) campaigns where attackers need to establish persistent access to cloud email and collaboration platforms after initial credential theft
- Detecting abnormal token revocation patterns from administrative accounts provides early warning before MFA bombing attempts begin, allowing defenders to contain the compromise at the administrative level
