## Why
- Discord CDN is a legitimate service commonly abused by threat actors to host malware while blending in with normal traffic
- PowerShell web requests to Discord CDN URLs downloading .dll/.exe files is highly suspicious behavior
- This technique allows attackers to bypass traditional file transfer detection methods
- The encrypted payloads enable malware delivery while evading network security controls
- This behavior has been observed in recent ransomware campaigns using Bumblebee loader
