| H073 | An adversary is abusing legitimate cloud storage services as command-and-control channels delivering fileless payloads via weaponized Office documents targeting defense and diplomatic organizations to conduct espionage while evading network-based detection. | Command and Control | Cloud storage C2 blends with legitimate traffic; fileless execution; compromised .gov sender accounts | #command_and_control #T1102_002 #T1203 #T1055 #cloud_c2 #apt28 #filen | Jinx (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- Cloud storage C2 blends with legitimate traffic and bypasses proxy/firewall allowlists
- Fileless + memory-only execution leaves zero disk artifacts
- Spear-phishing from compromised .gov accounts bypasses sender reputation
- Most orgs have zero visibility into which cloud storage services endpoints communicate with
