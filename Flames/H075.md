## Why

- UNC6201 deployed iptables rules listening for magic hex string on 443, redirecting to hidden backdoor port for 5 minutes — standard scanners never see it
- SPA/port-knocking rarely hunted in production
- Look for iptables recent module or hex-string matches
- Any appliance with these rules deserves immediate investigation
