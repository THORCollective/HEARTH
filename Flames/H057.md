# H057

Adversaries are executing PowerShell scripts that enumerate all accessible network shares and local drives to identify files containing authentication credentials such as passwords stored in batch files, administrative documents, spreadsheets, and configuration files for subsequent use in password spraying attacks against core banking systems.

## Why
- Plump Spider uses automated PowerShell scripts to perform extensive scans of network shares specifically to harvest credentials, which represents a critical pivot point between initial access and privilege escalation to core banking systems
- This technique directly enables the group's password spraying attacks against LDAP-integrated banking platforms by building contextualized wordlists from discovered credentials, dramatically increasing attack success rates
- Detection of this behavior provides an early warning before attackers gain access to core banking systems, as it occurs in Phase 3 of the attack cycle before the high-impact fraud execution phases
- The automated and broad nature of these scans creates distinctive patterns in file access logs and PowerShell execution telemetry that are highly detectable when proper monitoring is in place
- Financial institutions can interrupt the attack chain at this stage before adversaries compile the credential intelligence needed to compromise critical banking infrastructure
