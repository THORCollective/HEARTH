# H036

Threat actors are using Chisel, an open-source tunneling utility, to create SOCKS proxies on compromised hosts to bypass network security controls and conceal C2 traffic.

## Why
- Chisel proxies allow attackers to hide their true origin and bypass network controls like firewalls
- Tunneling C2 traffic through a proxy on the victim network helps avoid detection
- The CL-CRI-1014 cluster is using this technique to maintain stealthy access to financial institutions in Africa
