# H030

Threat actors are establishing persistence on macOS systems using LaunchDaemons that impersonate legitimate messaging services (like "Telegram2") but execute malicious binaries from non-standard locations.

## Why
- Detecting this behavior is crucial as LaunchDaemon persistence provides automatic execution at system startup with elevated privileges.
- If successful, this tactic ensures threat actor access survives system reboots and provides a reliable mechanism for maintaining presence.
- This behavior demonstrates sophisticated understanding of macOS persistence mechanisms while attempting to blend in with legitimate services.
