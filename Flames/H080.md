| H080 | An adversary is using fake human-verification prompts to trick users into executing clipboard-injected commands targeting hospitality sector organizations to deploy remote access trojans for credential theft and data exfiltration. | Initial Access | ClickFix technique; fake CAPTCHA prompts; clipboard command injection; bypasses email security; user-initiated execution | #initial_access #execution #command_and_control #T1566_002 #T1204_002 #T1219 #clickfix #social_engineering #rat | Jinx (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- ClickFix is evolving rapidly — sector-specific lures increase success rates beyond generic phishing
- The "run this command to verify" pattern bypasses email security entirely since the user initiates execution
- Clipboard-based command injection is hard to detect without endpoint telemetry on clipboard + shell activity
- Hospitality sector often has weaker security maturity — could expand to other verticals
