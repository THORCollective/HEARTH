## Why
- The hunt targets credential theft via DC sync attacks, which extract password hashes from domain controllers. Security risks include privilege escalation, lateral movement, and domain compromise. 
- This type of AD hunt delivers visibility into an attack technique that can go unnoticed due to gaps in identity security, especially in environments with limited detections/hardening.

## Implementation Notes
DC sync attacks leave behind a variety of indicators that include:
- Event ID 4662.
- Access Mask 0x100.
- Multiple GUIDs associated with domain replication permissions.
- Activity originating from a non-computer account.
