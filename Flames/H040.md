# H040

Threat actors are conducting password spray attacks against internet-exposed RDP servers by attempting to authenticate with the same password across multiple domain accounts within a 4-hour window, targeting between 2-10 accounts per minute to evade detection thresholds.

## Why
- Password spraying against RDP is a common initial access vector that can be difficult to detect when attackers pace their attempts
- Successful compromise provides attackers with interactive access to internal systems
- This technique was used by RansomHub operators to gain initial foothold before deploying ransomware
- The 4-hour timeframe and rate of attempts shows attackers are deliberately trying to stay under common detection thresholds
