| H067 | An adversary is registering typosquatted or trojanized MCP server packages in public registries and package managers targeting developers and AI agents that consume MCP tooling to achieve code execution or data exfiltration through tool poisoning. | Initial Access | First malicious MCP server found on npm in 2025. MCP servers have direct access to AI agents and connected systems — a compromised server can modify tool descriptions between sessions to inject prompts, exfiltrate context, or execute arbitrary code on the host. | #initial_access #T1195_002 #mcp #supply_chain #typosquatting #tool_poisoning #ai_agent | Jinx (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- MCP servers are distributed through the same package managers (npm, PyPI) already targeted by supply chain attacks, and typosquatted package names can trick developers into installing malicious servers that look identical to trusted ones
- Unlike traditional supply chain compromises, a malicious MCP server gains direct access to the AI agent's execution context — it can modify tool descriptions to inject hidden instructions, alter tool behavior between sessions, or exfiltrate sensitive data from the agent's conversation history
- Hunting for recently installed or updated MCP server packages that don't match an approved inventory, or monitoring for tool description changes between agent sessions, can surface compromised tooling before it's used in production
- The MCP ecosystem currently lacks standardized authentication and package signing, meaning there is no built-in mechanism to verify server integrity — organizations deploying MCP servers are relying entirely on manual vetting
