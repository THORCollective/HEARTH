# H077

An adversary is operating SparkRAT C2 servers identifiable through the default `/api/client/get/i18n` HTTP endpoint that returns a JSON language configuration with a distinctive `defaultLocale` field — a fingerprint that remains viable because the SparkRAT project has never implemented hardening against infrastructure discovery.

| H077 | An adversary is operating SparkRAT C2 servers identifiable through the default `/api/client/get/i18n` HTTP endpoint that returns a JSON language configuration with a distinctive `defaultLocale` field — a fingerprint that remains viable because the SparkRAT project has never implemented hardening against infrastructure discovery. | Command and Control | SparkRAT is a Go-based cross-platform RAT (Windows/Linux/macOS) popular with Chinese-speaking threat actors. The i18n endpoint is unauthenticated and present in every default deployment. Independently validated by multiple researchers with zero IOC overlap (different operators, same fingerprint). | #command_and_control #T1071_001 #T1105 #sparkrat #c2 #external_hunting #macos | Jinx & Salem (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- SparkRAT supports macOS implants — one of few open-source RATs with native macOS support
- The `/api/client/get/i18n` endpoint is unauthenticated and returns a distinctive JSON structure in EVERY default deployment
- SparkRAT devs have NEVER hardened against infrastructure fingerprinting (contrast with Sliver's multiple detection→patch cycles)
- Multiple confirmed live C2 servers found via this fingerprint, including operator clusters on shared hosting providers
- Independent researchers have discovered the same fingerprint with zero overlapping IOCs — different operator groups, same tool, same defaults
- JARM is not viable for SparkRAT (Go default TLS = all-zeroes on port 8000, generic nginx on 443)
