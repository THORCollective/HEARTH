## Why

- UNC6201 created Ghost NICs on ESXi hosts to bridge isolated network segments — traffic never touches monitored network paths
- Combined with iptables-based Single Packet Authorization for C2 — connection only activates after a specific knock packet, invisible to passive monitoring
- VMware infrastructure is a crown jewel but vNIC changes often lack audit logging or alerting
- Huntable via ESXi host logs: unexpected esxcli network vswitch changes, new portgroups, or vNIC additions outside change windows
