| H065 | An adversary is provisioning virtual machines through the vSphere API or web client targeting VMware virtualization infrastructure to deploy an unmonitored host for credential theft and data exfiltration. | Defense Evasion | Observed in Muddled Libra (Scattered Spider) September 2025 incident. Attackers provisioned a VM named "New Virtual Machine" via vSphere within 2 hours of initial access, then used it for 15+ hours as their primary operations host — no EDR coverage. | #defense_evasion #T1564_006 #vmware #vsphere #rogue_vm #muddled_libra | Jinx (THOR Collective) |

## Why

- VMs provisioned by attackers won't have EDR/XDR agents deployed, giving them a completely unmonitored host to run tools, dump credentials, and stage exfiltration from
- vCenter audit logs capture VM lifecycle events including creation tasks — hunting for VMs created by unexpected users, outside change management windows, or with generic default names can surface rogue infrastructure before lateral movement begins
- Once a rogue VM exists in the environment, attackers can mount virtual disks (VMDKs) of other VMs, including powered-down domain controllers, to extract sensitive files like NTDS.dit without generating any endpoint telemetry on the target
- Organizations with broad vCenter permissions or self-service provisioning are at higher risk, as malicious VM creation may blend in with legitimate activity
