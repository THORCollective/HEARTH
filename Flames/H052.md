# H052

Adversaries are using BackConnect VNC modules injected into dllhost.exe to execute Windows shell commands that open specific Explorer interfaces such as "shell:mycomputerfolder" for interactive file system browsing on compromised hosts.

## Why
- BackConnect VNC represents a distinctive post-exploitation capability historically associated with IcedID and now Latrodectus malware families, providing threat actors with interactive remote desktop access that bypasses traditional remote access monitoring
- This technique enables adversaries to manually browse file systems and identify high-value data for exfiltration while maintaining persistent access, as demonstrated in this intrusion where the threat actor used BackConnect to discover and access the unattend.xml file containing domain administrator credentials
- The specific command pattern of dllhost.exe spawning explorer.exe with shell URIs is highly anomalous and indicates hands-on-keyboard activity by sophisticated threat actors like Lunar Spider, who maintained access for nearly two months using this capability
- Detection of this behavior provides early warning of active threat actor reconnaissance and can prevent credential theft and data exfiltration before final impact objectives are achieved
