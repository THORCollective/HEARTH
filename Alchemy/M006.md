| M006         | Dictionary-based DGAs are a rare threat that require a model-based approach. These domains are algorithmically generated based on a dictionary of source words. Like traditional Domain Generation Algorithms, machine learning models can distinguish DGA / Non-DGA domains by training on sample data to learn on lexical features separating the classes. | Command and Control | <ul><li>Deploying a model-based detection against a high-volume logging source like web traffic can be costly and resource-intensive. For this task, I recommend a retroactive hunt using a deduplicated list of domains, enabling a quick and efficient M-ATH method for finding threats, or at least reducing our dataset for hunting.</br><li>This is an evolving research area. Efficacy of a model may be heavily tied to the timeliness of the data, or the inclusion of the target malware family in the underlying training set.</br><li>Sample data and pre-trained models are available for this hunt, however it is also possible to generate new data by modifying the reverse-engineered DGA algorithms [here](https://github.com/baderj/domain_generation_algorithms).</br><li>False positives may be caused by Content Delivery Networks, Ad-tracking mechanisms.  | #CommandandControl, #T1568.002, #DGA  |  [Ryan Fetterman](https://github.com/fetterm4n) 

## Why



- An incident discovered via this method is likely a high severity / high impact finding.
