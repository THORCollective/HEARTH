| M007         | Compare text-based features of artifacts (User agent strings, Malware / Executables, Browser Extensions) by encoding them with a text-vectorizer. Vectorization creates a numerical representation of the text-based feature which can then be clustered, or directly compared via a variety of similarity measures. | Command and Control, Execution | <ul><li>Data Collection and Preparation: Gather and encode data into numerical formats to support analysis (e.g., text vectorization or image hashing).</br><li>Similarity Analysis: Use similarity metrics (e.g., Levenshtein, cosine, or hash-based) to find related patterns or anomalies.</br><li>Clustering: Apply clustering (e.g., K-means) to group similar items, visualizing patterns and outliers.</br><li>Prioritization and Investigation: Flag clusters or anomalies for deeper analysis, focusing on items of interest or risk.  | #T1071.001 #T1203  |  [Ryan Fetterman](https://github.com/fetterm4n) 

## Why

- This is an important Model-Assisted methodology which can be applied to hunt for multiple types of threats.
- This hunt is grounded in two examples which showcase clustering vectorized text fields, and application of similarity measures pre- and post-vectorization, like Levenshtein, hamming, and euclidean distance.
