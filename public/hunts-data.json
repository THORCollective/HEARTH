By detecting DLL sideloading attempts, organizations can protect critical assets like sensitive data, intellectual property, and critical infrastructure from being compromised.\n- Why would this hunt be valuable to the community?</br>This DLL sideloading technique is particularly valuable because it is often missed by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems. This is due to the fact that DLL sideloading can masquerade as legitimate application behavior, making it difficult for EDRs to differentiate between benign and malicious activity. Attackers exploit trusted binaries to load their malicious DLLs, effectively bypassing security controls.\nBy conducting hunts specifically targeting this behavior, we can identify and mitigate threats that would otherwise go undetected by traditional EDR solutions.

    "why": "- Nearly every attack technique produces an abnormal process parent-child relationship — chrome.exe spawning finger.exe, winword.exe spawning powershell.exe, or svchost.exe spawning cmd.exe with encoded arguments all stand out when measured against fleet-wide frequency baselines\n- Frequency stacking across the fleet turns rarity into signal — a process pair seen on 3 out of 10,000 endpoints is worth investigating regardless of whether that specific combination appears in any detection rule\n- This approach catches novel techniques without prior signatures because it measures deviation from normal rather than matching known bad — new LOLBINs, renamed binaries, and zero-day exploitation all produce unusual lineages\n- Process creation data with parent process context is already collected by most EDR tools and Sysmon, making this immediately actionable without deploying additional telemetry",
